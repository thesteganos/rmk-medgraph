# --- External Tools Configuration ---
# This section configures API keys for external tools used by the agent.

# For the PubMed Search Tool (src/tools.py)
# NCBI requires an email to use their Entrez API. This is for identification purposes
# and helps them contact you if your script causes issues. It is not used for spam.
ENTREZ_EMAIL="your.email@example.com"

# This is optional but highly recommended for the PubMed tool.
# Using an API key gives you much higher rate limits (from 3 requests/sec to 10/sec).
# You can get one by creating a free account at NCBI.
